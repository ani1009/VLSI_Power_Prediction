ðŸ”§ Goal:

Predict the power consumption of a digital design (like a processor block or a datapath) using high-level RTL features.

ðŸ“Œ Why Important in VLSI:

Early prediction of power helps reduce simulation time and avoids over-design. It speeds up the design cycle and helps in power-performance-area (PPA) optimization.
